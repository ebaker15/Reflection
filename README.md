Today I wrote a code that puts two words in a list together which guesses the wifi password. The wifi password is two words, and out of a list of 10,000 words, there are 1,000,000 possibilities which means that it would take 190 years to complete due to the fact that each password takes 1 second to load and process. Then we created functions.

Today I finally cracked the password. It took me so long, I worked on my code late into the night, and worked on it all chances I got. I asked for assistance with my if statement, and I was told to use parenthesees. When I used them, my code finally worked.

Today we worked on working on a code for breaking the new wifi password. The wifi password was only 1's and 0's. The if statements and loops are beating me up.

Today we worked on our python code that creates a box that follows the constraints of which was given in the variables to create the box. When I started it, the x and y variables were kicking my butt, until I found out the correct way to state them. I still need to mulitply them so I can keep the measurements.

Today we worked on a program that turns military time into civilian time. It uses a lot of conditionals and other variables to work.

Today we worked on making a dictionary that told us what types of games there were. The variables were very incredible to how precise it is. Afterward, we worked on the pokemon project.

Today we worked on finishing up our website. The website had a problem loading images. The format for the images were correct, though I believe there is something in the code that is prohibiting it from coming up.

Today we worked on learning Python, a plethora of mind-numbing commands that are strict. Though, python will tell you which line your mistake is on, but sadly it won't tell you what is wrong with it. We also learned about the four types of variables, string, integer, float, and boolean. These variables are the ones that we have to use in python.

Today we worked on the website, I found a purpose for my website, and I started to work on it. I went onto multiple supercell sponsored websites to gather the correct data for my website.

Today we worked on the fundamentals of HTML. We learned CSS and Bootstrap, and we started a base for a  website. CSS is what is used to make the colors apepar. Bootstrap is a basic outline for a website.

Today, I learnead the fundamentals of HTML. We fixed the githubthe desktop, which allowed us to submit our work. We also got the new wifi router. Only for educational use in the classroom. I also wrote a .bat file code which allowed us to automagically submit our work by typing 4 words in command line.

Today we worked with Binary. Binary is the language of which computers communicate. It tells the proccessor what to do, and tells the hard drive what to grab.
