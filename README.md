Today, I learnead the fundamentals of HTML. We fixed the githubthe desktop, which allowed us to submit our work. We also got the new wifi router. Only for educational use in the classroom. I also wrote a .bat file code which allowed us to automagically submit our work by typing 4 words in command line.
